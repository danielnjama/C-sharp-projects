## 1. Random Number Generator:

**Task: Create a program that generates and prints a random number between a user-defined range.**
Questions:
How would you take user input for the range of random numbers?
Can you ensure that the generated number is within the specified range?

## 2. Character Counter:

**Task: Develop a program that counts the number of occurrences of a specific character in a given string.**
Questions:
How will you handle user input for the string and the character to count?
Can you account for both uppercase and lowercase occurrences of the character?
## 3. Palindrome Checker:

**Task: Build a program that checks if a given word is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).**
Questions:
How would you handle spaces and capitalization in the word input?
Can you implement the palindrome check using loops or recursion?

## 4. Simple Calculator:

**Task: Create a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.**
Questions:
How will you design the user interface for accepting arithmetic operations and operands?
Can you handle invalid input gracefully?

## 5. Prime Number Checker:

**Task: Develop a program that checks if a given number is prime.**
Questions:
How would you optimize the algorithm to check for primality?
Can you implement error handling for non-numeric inputs?

## 6. Fibonacci Sequence Generator:

**Task: Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified limit.**
Questions:
How will you structure the program to calculate and display the Fibonacci sequence?
Can you handle large sequence limits?

## 7. Reverse a String:

**Task: Create a program that reverses a given string.**
Questions:
How would you handle input validation for the string?
Can you implement the reversal without using built-in reverse functions?

## 8. Even-Odd Number Checker:

**Task: Build a program that checks if a given number is even or odd.**
Questions:
How will you handle non-numeric input?
Can you implement the check using bitwise operations?

## 9. Factorial Calculator:

**Task: Develop a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.**
Questions:
How would you handle non-integer input?
Can you optimize the calculation using recursion or iteration?

## 10. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:

**Task: Create a simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game.**
Questions:
How will you structure the game loop?
Can you display the results and ask the user if they want to play again?
